1658. Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero

You are given an integer array nums and an integer x. In one operation, you can either remove the leftmost or the rightmost element from the array nums and subtract its value from x. Note that this modifies the array for future operations.

Return the minimum number of operations to reduce x to exactly 0 if it is possible, otherwise, return -1.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,4,2,3], x = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The optimal solution is to remove the last two elements to reduce x to zero.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,6,7,8,9], x = 4
Output: -1
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,2,20,1,1,3], x = 10
Output: 5
Explanation: The optimal solution is to remove the last three elements and the first two elements (5 operations in total) to reduce x to zero.

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 104
1 <= x <= 109

정방향, 역방향 psum을 구한다음에 bisect로 검색해서 해결했다.
한 쪽만 구하고 반대 방향을 더해가면서 이진탐색을 해도 되었는데 복잡하게 풀었다

가장 긴 중간 subarray를 구하는 풀이도 있었다. 

We could use dfs+memo or BFS, but they are too slow and will TLE (?)
If it exists an answer, then it means we have a subarray in the middle of original array whose sum is == totalSum - x
If we want to minimize our operations, then we should maximize the length of the middle subarray.
Then the qeustion becomes: Find the Longest Subarray with Sum Equals to TotalSum - X
We could simply use Map + Prefix Sum to get it!
